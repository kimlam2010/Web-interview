        "Singleton Pattern",
        "Observer Pattern", 
        "Strategy Pattern",
        "Factory Pattern"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Strategy Pattern",
      "explanation": "Strategy pattern allows different algorithms to be selected at runtime, perfect for plugin systems where different protocols (MQTT, OPC-UA, Modbus) can be implemented as interchangeable strategies.",

        "O(n)",
        "O(n²)"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "O(n²)",
      "explanation": "SLAM algorithms typically have O(n²) complexity due to the need to maintain and update a covariance matrix for all landmarks and robot poses.",
